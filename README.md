# 3DEngine
**Experimental Abstraction of OpenGL**

## Description
This repository serves as a practical exploration of the mathematical foundations of 3D game engines and animation software. It focuses on implementing core 3D operations and mathematical concepts necessary for developing a 3D engine from scratch.

## Key Areas of Exploration
- **3D Transformations:** Implementations of translation, rotation, and scaling using various mathematical representations (e.g., matrices, quaternions).
- **Camera Systems:** Developing camera movement and projection systems to simulate different viewing perspectives.
- **Geometry and Mesh Operations:** Handling vertex data, creating geometries (e.g., boxes, cones), and applying transformations.
- **Animation and Physics:** Implementing basic animation techniques and physics simulations.
- **Rendering Techniques:** Basics of shader programming, buffer management, and rendering pipelines in OpenGL.

This project aims to provide a deeper understanding of the mathematics and algorithms that power modern 3D graphics and animation systems, and it serves as a foundation for building more advanced graphics engines and tools.
